# Overview

This project focuses on designing a reliable, redundant, and secure communication network to transport data, video, telemetry, and voice from a Smart Building on the Moon to one or more Control Centers on Earth.
Our goal is to propose multiple network architectures, simulate them, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and recommend the best design.

# Requirements

- 3 unique network designs

- Network simualtion/model

- Recommendation of best design

- Consider speed of light, distance, and radiation
